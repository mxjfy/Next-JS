# Components
    $ HEAD
        . Head component is used to modify the <head> section of the HTML document. It allows you to set metadata such as title, meta tags, and links to external stylesheets or scripts. This is particularly useful for setting up the page's SEO attributes and ensuring that the correct metadata is presented to search engines and social media platforms.

    $ SCRIPT
        . The Script component in Next.js is used to include external scripts or inline scripts within a page. This can be helpful for integrating third-party libraries or for running custom JavaScript code within the page. The Script component provides a way to include such scripts in a way that ensures they are properly loaded and executed within the Next.js application.
